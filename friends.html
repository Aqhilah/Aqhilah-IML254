<td style="color:#3e2716; font-size: 25px;">These are my best friends since I was 9 years old until today, Nur Asyifa and Syazwani. Even though one is now working and the other is studying at a different university, we remain close friends. They are very kind, cheerful, and have always been there for me through my ups and downs.

Interestingly, our mothers are also good friends.

<td style="color:#3e2716; font-size: 25px;">These are my most special friends, who have been by my side throughout my diploma journey. We shared our joys and sorrows, worked on assignments together, ate and slept together, and celebrated every semester's success as a team. They feel like my second family.

<td style="color:#3e2716; font-size: 25px;">Appreciation post to my own self: For always being there when no one else is, for being my own constant source of encouragement, and for never giving up on me, even when times get tough. Through every challenge, I've been my own biggest supporter, lifting myself up and reminding myself of my strength and resilience when things seemed impossible.
